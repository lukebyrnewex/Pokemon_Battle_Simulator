Number, Title, Description
1, Nature_Values, "A Pokémon's nature gives a 10% increase in a certain stat, whilst reducing another by 10%. For example, a Pokémon with base 50 Attack and Special Attack of Adamant nature will have an increased Attack stat at 50 * 1.1 (55), but a reduced Special Attack stat at 55 * 0.9 (45)."
2, Individual_Values, "Each Pokémon has a specific set of IVs, or Individual Values which are essentially its genes. Pokémon with a maximum IV of 31 in a certain stat will have the maximum possible genetic amount for their species. Sometimes it is beneficial to have no IVs, such as when you want a Pokémon to be as slow as possible: a 0 IV in that stat would be preferable."
3, Effort_Values, "EVs, or Effort Values, are the final hurdle in truly fine-tuning your Pokémon. A Pokémon has a maximum of 510 EVs to distribute between its stats, with 4 EVs in one stat equalling one stat point increase, thus giving a Pokémon, for example, 7 EVs in one stat will only increase it by one stat point, not 2, as it would require 8 EVs then. As well, a Pokémon can only have a maximum of 255 EVs in one stat, and 510 EVs in total thus giving it more than 252 EVs in one stat is redundant. The most common spread is 252 EVs in two stats, and 4 in another, however, you can select whatever you like in order to suit your particular Pokémons strengths and weaknesses."
